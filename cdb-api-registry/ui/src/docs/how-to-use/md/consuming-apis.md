# Consuming APIs securely

Follow these practices to securely consume APIs in different environments.

## Authentication
- Use OAuth 2.0 or API keys as provided
- Never commit secrets to source control

## Environments
- Prefer environment variables for base URLs
- Use staging before production

## Error handling
Handle HTTP errors and timeouts gracefully. Implement retries where appropriate.

## Next steps
Explore the Try It Out tab on API detail pages to interact with endpoints.
